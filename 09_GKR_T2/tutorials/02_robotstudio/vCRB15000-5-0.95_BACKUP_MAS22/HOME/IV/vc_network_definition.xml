     This XML-file makes it possible to connect to a camera from a
     virtual controller. 
	 
	 This file is read at startup of the virtual controller. To take effect, 
     the file must be named vc_network_definition.xml and placed in the 
     HOME/IV directory of the virtual controller. 
      
 	 Change the "SERVICE" IP address to the IP address of the PC network
     adapter that is connected to the camera.
